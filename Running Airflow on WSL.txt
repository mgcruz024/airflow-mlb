How to install Airflow on Windows with WSL (Windows Subset for Linux)

## Airflow is optimized for Linux and Ubuntu, so we are installing it via Windows Subset for Linux, a V.M. created
by Windows that allows users to running Linux OS. ##


FIRST TIME STEPS

1. Open up your Command Line as the Admin.

	Install WSL
	wsl --install

2. Enable WSL and (if you are Windows 11) VM. 

Type "Turn Windows features on and off" in the Windows Start Menu and scroll down to "Windows Subset
for Linux" and check on the box. If you are on Windows 11, also check "VM" to use WSL 2.0.

Restart your system. 

3. Download Python and virtualenv on Ubuntu since we will be usin Python scripts to create our Airflow DAGS.

Go to the Windows Start Menu and run Ubuntu as an Admin. 

	brew install python3
	pip3 install virtualenv

4. Navigate to target directory and create virtual environment (virtualenv is not mandatory but it is good practice
to download dependencies separately).

	python3 -m venv airflow-env

5. Activate the virtual environment.

	source airflow-env/bin/activate

6. Save the airflow directory path in the editor.

	nano ~/.bashrc

	AIRFLOW_HOME=/home/mgcruz/airflow

Press Ctrl+S and Ctrl+X to exit the editor. The next time you start the terminal you can type the following
to head right to the airflow directory:

	cd $AIRFLOW_HOME

7. Install Apache Airflow.

	pip install apache-airflow

8. Initialize Airflow and create your users. I advice to add your own email so that you can make use of the EmailOperator.

	airflow db init
	airflow users create \
	    --username admin \
	    --password admin  \
	    --firstname Miguel \
	    --lastname Cruz \
	    --role Admin \
	    --email your_email@email.com


9. Run the Web Server and Scheduler.

	airflow webserver --port 8080
	airflow scheduler

10. Search http://localhost:8080 on the browser and enter credentials.

username: admin
password: admin
